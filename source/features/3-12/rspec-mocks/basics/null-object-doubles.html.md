# Null object doubles

[Test doubles](./test-doubles) are strict by default, raising errors when they receive messages that have not
  been allowed or expected. You can chain `as_null_object` off of `double` in order to make
  the double "loose". For any message that has not explicitly allowed or expected, the double
  will return itself. It acts as a black hole null object, allowing arbitrarily deep method chains.

## `as_null_object` allows arbitrarily deep message chains and returns itself

_Given_ a file named "as_null_object_spec.rb" with:

```ruby
RSpec.describe "as_null_object" do
  it "returns itself" do
    dbl = double("Some Collaborator").as_null_object
    expect(dbl.foo.bar.bazz).to be(dbl)
  end
end
```

_When_ I run `rspec as_null_object_spec.rb`

_Then_ the examples should all pass.

## Individual methods can still be allowed or expected

_Given_ a file named "as_null_object_spec.rb" with:

```ruby
RSpec.describe "as_null_object" do
  it "can allow individual methods" do
    dbl = double("Some Collaborator", :foo => 3).as_null_object
    allow(dbl).to receive(:bar).and_return(4)

    expect(dbl.foo).to eq(3)
    expect(dbl.bar).to eq(4)
  end
end
```

_When_ I run `rspec as_null_object_spec.rb`

_Then_ the examples should all pass.
